<?php
/* A PHP script signifies the start of the PHP code, and it can be written anywhere in the document.
 * The opening tag is <?php.
 *
 * It uses a built in function "echo"(Not neccessarily a function)
 *
 * One can use parentheses with "echo" as echo ("string"); but they are not compulsory because echo isn't really a function.
 *
 * The closing tag is ?>
 *
 * NB: Every code in PHP is written between the starting (<?php) and ending (?>)symbol.
 * Also, the code will still execute without the closing tag.
 *
 * PHP must be terminated with a semicolon
 *
 * Just like sentences in English terminated with a period.
 * Just as sentences in English can span several lines, so can the statements in PHP.*/
